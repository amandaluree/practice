      <h2>What Are The Best Halloween Animals?</h2>
      <h3>Cats</h3>

      <p>What would All Hallows’s Eve be without cats—in particular, black cats?
        Not without reason, during Medieval times those inscrutable felines were
        considered the “familiars” of witches: their constant companions, protectors,
        and assistants in the practice of magic. In the West, black has often been
        associated with evil, and so a cat with a pelt black as pitch would be looked
        upon as especially inauspicious and malevolent.</p>

      <h3>Rats</h3>
      <p><img src="rat.jpg" alt="a brown rat" height="300" width="400"></p>
      <p>Highly adaptable, the black rat (Rattus rattus) easily habituates itself to
        human settlements and can be found—sometimes swarming in frighteningly great
        numbers—almost anywhere that people have established cities. Largely nocturnal
        creatures, they are sneaky and secretive, favoring dark, out-of-the-way places,
        yet thrive right under our very noses: lurking in filthy alleyways, scurrying
        through dank subway tunnels, and nesting inside the drywall of our homes. It goes
        without saying that they seem to be partial to graveyards and crypts as well!</p>

        <h3>Bats</h3>
        <p><img src="bat.jpg" alt="a brown bat" height="300" width="400"></p>
        <p>Often characterized (unfairly) as “rats with wings,” bats are by nature nocturnal
          creatures. Thanks to movies and our own imaginations, everything about them screams,
          “Vampire!” They sleep during the day in dark caves and belfries, they forage at night,
          and some species even feed on the blood of livestock. And even though a bite from one
          won’t turn you into an actual vampire, it can conceivably give you rabies, which is almost
          as bad.</p>
